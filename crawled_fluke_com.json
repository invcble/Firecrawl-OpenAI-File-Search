      "markdown": "[Skip to main content](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance/preventive-vs-predictive-vs-proactive#main-content)\n\n[English](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance/preventive-vs-predictive-vs-proactive#country-picker-mobile)\n\nSearch\n\n# Preventive maintenance vs predictive maintenance vs proactive maintenance\n\n[Predictive maintenance](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance)\n\nKeeping plants up and running at maximum efficiency and with minimum unplanned downtime is the goal of every maintenance team. Achieving those levels of uptime requires maintaining assets in such a way that it allows you to catch a problem before it takes down your operation. The question is how best to do that.\n\nHistorically, most plants have operated with a reactive maintenance strategy—running to failure and then fixing the equipment when it breaks down. That can be very costly in downtime, wasted product, shorter equipment life cycles, and increased equipment replacement and labor costs.\n\n![Preventive maintenance vs predictive maintenance vs proactive maintenance](https://dam-assets.fluke.com/s3fs-public/preventive-predictive-proactive-maintenance.jpg)\n\nMany plants still use some level of reactive maintenance. But industrial equipment has become more automated, and troubleshooting and diagnostic tools have become more available, accurate, and affordable. Today, more and more industrial plants have started taking a proactive approach to maintenance. The immediate goal is to find and fix problems before there’s a breakdown. The long-term goal is to reduce unplanned outages and extend asset life.\n\n## Preventive maintenance reduces risk\n\nOne alternative to reactive maintenance is [preventive maintenance](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance/test-measurement-preventive-maintenance), which establishes a regular maintenance schedule for each machine. This helps reduce equipment failure and extend equipment life, but it also is labor intensive. Preventive maintenance intervals are typically based on recommendations from equipment manufacturers rather than on specific data related to each machine. That can lead to excessive maintenance and unnecessary component replacement based solely on time, rather than on the actual condition of the component. This approach also requires shutting down the equipment, which can have a negative impact on production. Still, preventive maintenance has proven more cost effective than reactive maintenance because, in addition to reducing unplanned downtime, it also saves energy by keeping equipment running more efficiently.\n\n## Predictive maintenance sees around corners\n\nPredictive maintenance is sometimes confused with preventive maintenance in that it is designed to address potential equipment problems before they cause a breakdown. However, rather than performing maintenance tasks based strictly on time intervals, predictive maintenance uses real world data from the equipment to determine when and what to perform maintenance on. It applies algorithms to that data to find trends in key indicators, such as temperature, vibration, electrical, pressure, and other measurements that can indicate when a failure is likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the data used in these calculations is collected in real time with infrared technology and wireless or wired condition monitoring sensors while the equipment is running. This helps create a more accurate and comprehensive picture of both individual assets and the health of the operation as a whole.\n\n## Building a proactive maintenance program\n\nPredictive and preventive maintenance approaches work together to influence a proactive maintenance strategy. By collecting baseline data, tracking trends, and analyzing data after fault indications are found, a proactive maintenance strategy helps organizations perform maintenance only when necessary, based on real world information. It can also help make predictive and preventive maintenance programs work more efficiently to help avoid the root causes of machine failure, address problems before they cause failure, and extend machine life.\n\nThe biggest challenge in establishing a proactive maintenance program is determining how best to direct your maintenance resources. Analyzing the data from both healthy and faulty equipment can help you determine when a piece of equipment may fail. But, because most organizations have limited maintenance resources, the next challenge is to decide which failures pose the biggest risk to your operation.\n\n## How to assess maintenance priorities\n\nSo, in addition to collecting performance data, it is helpful to assess the criticality of each asset. Rather than simply rating assets as “critical” or “non-critical” you can [classify your assets into four categories](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance/criticality-analysis) of criticality based on the impact of that asset on the company’s ability to generate revenue. Those four categories are:\n\n1. **Star Athletes**, which are assets that directly determine your organization’s ability to win, and by how much. In addition to simple uptime and downtime, there’s a direct relationship between performance and revenue to your company. Every bit of performance improvement means additional revenue. These assets need constant attention and monitoring, regardless of their age. Examples include turbine generators, large ship engines, and large process kilns and furnaces. Basic manufacturing plants may have few or no assets in this category. Continuous process industries often have many interconnected star athlete assets.\n2. **Critical assets** are those that must be up and running in order for your company to make money. In the case of municipal services, public facilities, or non-profit organizations, or others that don’t generate revenue, these assets must be running to fulfill the organization’s mission, operate within budget, or provide the expected level of service. Performance is less of an issue. If things are spinning, conveyors are moving, or hydraulics are actuating, the assets can help your organization make money. Uptime is the key performance indicator so it is critical to be able to anticipate pending failures. Note that critical assets aren’t necessarily big and complex. Sometimes a chemical process depends on a simple solenoid valve, or a food processing line depends on whether a $20 motor is dispensing material out of a hopper.\n3. **Semi-critical assets** are those that don’t necessarily stop production when they go down but do strain the system. For example, a warehouse or distribution center has four forklifts, and one goes down. Things keep moving, but the remaining forklifts must work 33% faster or longer. Or if an automated rivet press on a production line goes down, the line won’t stop but production personnel will have to pick up the slack by manually driving the rivets. This increases labor costs and slows down production.\n4. **Non-critical assets** do not affect the company’s ability to generate revenue—no matter how big, expensive, or complex they may be, but there still may be reasons to fix these assets. For example, if you have a rotating company sign in front of your building that stops rotating or goes dark, you still need to fix it to maintain your company image.\n\nThese criticality classifications are just general guidelines. One company’s non-critical asset may be another’s star athlete. It is important that you classify your assets in terms that meet the specific situation in your company and plan your maintenance strategy accordingly.\n\n[Speak with a specialist](https://info.fluke.com/multi-fluke-webpage-demo-form?cidn=fs-cm-ow-flukeweb-na&prodinq=Fluke+Sensor \"(opens in a new window)\")\n\n## You might also be interested in\n\nArticle\n\n### [How to Perform IMD, SPD, and Voltage Drop Tests with the Fluke 1674 FC](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance/how-to-test-imd-spd-voltage-drop)\n\n[Maintenance and monitoring](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/maintenance-monitoring), [Predictive maintenance](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance)\n\nArticle\n\n### [ROI Calculator: See Your Savings with the Fluke 1670 Series](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance/1670-series-roi-calculator)\n\n[Predictive maintenance](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance), [Maintenance and monitoring](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/maintenance-monitoring)\n\nArticle\n\n### [Four Reasons to Upgrade Your Multifunction Installation Tester Now](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance/4-reasons-upgrade-multifunction-tester)\n\n[Maintenance and monitoring](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/maintenance-monitoring), [Predictive maintenance](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance)\n\nArticle\n\n### [4 Steps to preventing motor failure](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/motors-drives-pumps-compressors/preventing-motor-failure)\n\n[Motors, drives, pumps, compressors](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/motors-drives-pumps-compressors), [Predictive maintenance](https://www.fluke.com/en/learn/blog/predictive-maintenance)\n\nChat with ourFluke assistant\n\n\nClear Chat\n\nHi, I’m your virtual assistant, I will do my very best to help you navigate all things Fluke related.

Learn how to protect yourself from grey market products and counterfeit Fluke tools.\n\n## What are Grey Market products?\n\nGrey market products may be tools, parts, and/or accessories sold outside of a company’s authorized distribution channels.\n\n## Ensure your Fluke tools benefit from the manufacturer warranty\n\nCustomers should be aware that while Fluke products from grey market sellers may be genuine, these sellers may lack the capability to provide aftersales support and product training. Furthermore, customers take the risk that their purchases are not protected by the original manufacturer’s warranty.\n\nFluke tools enjoy the full benefit of an original manufacturer’s warranty, but this protection is only available when the tool is purchased through an authorized source. When it comes to electrical safety, your tools must perform to the highest standard. That’s why Fluke products not only comply with but exceed the requirements of IEC standards. When you buy from an authorized distributor, or directly through Fluke, you ensure those safety standards and full manufacturer warranty are there for you.\n\nOften, grey market sellers will pick up inventory from another source and resell it to make a profit. However, the warranty services provided by Fluke can only be obtained in the country the tool was originally purchased from Fluke or from a local authorized Fluke distributor or reseller.\n\nCustomers should be aware that only Fluke tools supplied by authorized distributors and resellers or directly from Fluke will be eligible for a product warranty, free-of-charge warranty repairs, and other services.\n\n## How to spot a grey market seller\n\nRecent advances with online shopping have made it easy for anyone to buy from online marketplaces, auction sites, or from sellers’ websites all over the world. These unauthorized resellers lead to grey market sales, or sales that go around the authorized distribution channels. These kinds of grey market sellers do not have a relationship with the original manufacturer of the tools since Fluke has not authorized these sellers.\n\nThere are many grey market sellers retailing Fluke products at artificially low prices. If the price appears too good, this lower price should raise a red flag that the tool may be grey market or possibly [counterfeit](https://www.fluke.com/en-us/where-to-buy/counterfeit-awareness).\n\nAs you’re shopping online, especially on websites that aggregate multiple sellers on one marketplace, double check where the seller is located and shipping from so you can be certain you are looking at genuine Fluke products being sold through one of our authorized distributors.\n\n## Authorized distributors\n\nTo ensure you purchase a genuine Fluke product, buy online or through one of our authorized distributors.

Save it. Share it.**\n\nAll the facts, right in the field. The Fluke a3002 FC Wireless AC/DC Current Module is one member of a family of wireless test tools that let you share test data using the Fluke Connect® app with ShareLive™ video call.\n\nFluke Connect Wireless Test Tools put tools, not your body, near live electrical panels. It's simple. Connect the a3002 FC current module, or any of the other Fluke Connect remote modules, and read the results on the Fluke Connect Wireless Multimeter or a portable PC from a safe distance.\n\nBetter still, the Fluke Connect test tools can send measurement data to your smartphone, so you can save and share measurements from the field with your team anytime, from anywhere.\n\n**Don't get bogged down while isolating intermittent electrical faults**\n\nTiming is everything when trying to find an intermittent problem and the hard part is, it doesn't always show up when you have your meter connected. We've solved that problem with Fluke Connect - leave your remote modules connected to log measurements and walk away to address other issues. You can then download the data for further analysis.\n\n**Work safely near electrical panels while wearing less PPE**\n\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE) can save your life, but it's bulky, hot and hard to work in. With Fluke Connect, there's no need to work in front of live open panels or moving/hazardous machinery.\n\nPicture having the ability to access live readings without being exposed to the live panel. It's easy. Just de-energize the cabinet, open the panel while wearing PPE and connect one or more a3002 FC modules. Close the cabinet, re-energize and let the Fluke Connect system work, reducing the risk of arc flash by separating yourself from hazardous measurement situations.\n\n**Testing 3-phase is now faster and cheaper**\n\nWhen your cabinet is de-energized, attach a Fluke Connect current clamp to each phase. Close, re-energize and start taking readings. What used to take hours and use costly equipment can be done in minutes with an affordable Fluke Connect wireless system.\n\n**Take 3-phase measurements in 1/3 of the time. Add your laptop and go from logging to analysis and diagnosis.**\n\nYou can solve problems faster by seeing live measurements from multiple test points on a single screen. Using a3002 FC current clamp modules with either Fluke i410 or i1010 AC/DC current clamps (not included with module), you can:\n\n- Take 3-phase measurements in 1/3 the time of previous methods.\n- Send data to your laptop and go from logging to analysis and diagnosis.\n- Record over time to monitor circuit load changes for an hour, a shift or a week.\n- Use the Fluke Connect wireless USB adapter to collect logged data from remote modules by walking past a working module and downloading logged data.\n- Perform for analysis with your PC and share the results using Fluke Cloud™ storage and ShareLive™ video call. View data or graphs to get input from team members.\n\n### What's in the box:\n\n- a3002 True-RMS AC/DC Current Module\n- Magnetic hanging strap\n- Quick Reference Guide\n\n## Specifications: Fluke a3002 FC Wireless AC/DC Current Module\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| AC/DC Current Function |\n| A DC | **Range / resolution** | 1000 A / 0.1 A |\n| Accuracy1 | (0.5% + 3) |\n| A AC | **Range / resolution** | 600.0 A / 0.1 A |\n| Accuracy1 | (1.0% + 3) |\n| 1\\.

Learn how to protect yourself from grey market products and counterfeit Fluke tools.\n\n## What are Grey Market products?\n\nGrey market products may be tools, parts, and/or accessories sold outside of a company’s authorised distribution channels. As these sales are unauthorised, the manufacturer is unable to guarantee that the products are authentic and therefore safe, meeting quality standards, or covered by the manufacturer’s warranty.\n\n## Ensure your Fluke tools benefit from the manufacturer’s warranty\n\nCustomers should be aware that while Fluke products from grey market sellers may be genuine, these sellers may lack the capability to provide aftersales support and product training. Furthermore, customers take the risk that their purchases are not protected by the original manufacturer’s warranty.\n\nFluke tools enjoy the full benefit of an original manufacturer’s warranty, but this protection is only available when the tool is purchased through an authorised source. When it comes to electrical safety, your tools must perform to the highest standard. That’s why Fluke products not only comply with but exceed the requirements of IEC standards. When you buy from an authorised distributor, or directly through Fluke, you ensure that those safety standards and full manufacturer’s warranty are there for you.\n\nOften, grey market sellers will pick up inventory from another source and resell it to make a profit. However, the warranty services provided by Fluke can only be obtained in the country the tool was originally purchased from Fluke or from a local authorised Fluke distributor or reseller.\n\nCustomers should be aware that only Fluke tools supplied by authorised distributors and resellers or directly from Fluke will be eligible for a product warranty, free-of-charge warranty repairs, and other services.\n\n## How to spot a grey market seller\n\nRecent advances with online shopping have made it easy for anyone to buy from online marketplaces, auction sites, or from sellers’ websites all over the world. These unauthorised resellers lead to grey market sales, or sales that circumvent the authorised distribution channels. These kinds of grey market sellers do not have a relationship with the original manufacturer of the tools since Fluke has not authorised these sellers.\n\nThere are many grey market sellers retailing Fluke products at artificially low prices. If the price appears too good, this lower price should raise a red flag that the tool may be grey market or possibly counterfeit.\n\nAs you’re shopping online, especially on websites that aggregate multiple sellers on one marketplace, double check where the seller is located and shipping from so you can be certain you are looking at genuine Fluke products being sold through one of our authorised distributors.\n\n## Authorised distributors\n\nTo ensure you purchase a genuine Fluke product, buy online or through one of our authorised distributors. For an authorised Fluke partner near you, visit [https://www.fluke.com/en-au/where-to-buy](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/where-to-buy)\n\n[iframe](https://a24704070387.cdn.optimizely.com/client_storage/a24704070387.html)",

Large compressors, motors, welding machines, arc furnaces, power factor correction capacitors and other large electrical machinery along with system impedance can easily cause voltage dips, swells, and transients.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [Five problems you will never uncover with a digital multimeter](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/oscilloscopes/five-problems-you-will-never-uncover-with-a-digital-multimeter)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of investing in the right set of tools to monitor power quality issues, and prevent them in the future, can't be emphasized enough. Fluke offers an extensive range of excellent power meters and other power quality tools for troubleshooting, preventive maintenance, and long-term recording and analysis in industrial applications and utilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [Foundation™ Fieldbus: System and diagnostic basics](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/oscilloscopes/foundation-fieldbus-system-and-diagnostic-basics)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current trend in factory automation is to replace traditional control schemes in which each device has its own control wiring with bus systems that link a number of devices via the same cable. One benefit of bus networks is that they require far fewer cables and wires to connect devices to controllers. One of the most popular and widely used of these bus systems is Foundation Fieldbus.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [Hybrid vehicle measurement safety basics: Taking high-voltage readings](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/automotive/hybrid-vehicle-measurement-safety-basics-taking-high-voltage-readings)\n\n\n\n\n\nHybrid vehicle technology may be in its infancy, but the field is growing rapidly. Every major auto and truck manufacturer is developing hybrids, and hybrid technology is a stepping-stone to advanced electric-drive components that will be used in both hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and pure electric vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [Tools for testing electronic circuits](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/oscilloscopes/testing-electronic-circuits)\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its introduction nearly 40 years ago, the 555 timer IC and its companion 556 dual timer have inspired hobbyists, technicians, inventors, engineers, and many others who love to experiment with electronic circuits. An Internet search on \"555 timer\" yields millions of hits. Using \"555 timer projects\" as the search phrase yields more than 800,000 hits.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [Evaluating relative humidity: Key factors and measurements](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/hvac/evaluating-relative-humidity-key-factors-and-measurements)\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, relative humidity, and dew point temperature is essential in all facets of air conditioning. These psychrometric processes play an especially important role in building and materials integrity, occupant health and comfort, and overall indoor air quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [Diagnosing mold problems](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/hvac/diagnosing-mold-problems)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the possible problems in facilities today is the presence and effects of mold on the indoor environment. Molds are normally present in nature. They reproduce by means of tiny spores that float through the air and are invisible to the naked eye. They can grow on wood, paper, carpet, foods, and insulation - but none of the many types of mold will grow without water or moisture. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth will often occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains unaddressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [Insulation resistance and electrical testing for HVAC compressor motors](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/hvac/insulation-resistance-and-electrical-testing-for-hvac-compressor-motors)\n\n\n\n\n\nHVACR mechanics rarely rely on a single test to pass or fail a function or process. As they walk up to a condensing unit, they listen, they wave their hand over the condenser discharge air, and then they grab the suction line, the liquid line, and the discharge line (and wish they hadn't done that). All of this before they even open their tool box.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [When start-up inspections pay off for HVAC](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/hvac/when-start-up-inspections-pay-off-for-hvac)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter years of being a serviceman - slinging ladders, dragging tools across attics and through crawlspaces, standing in all sorts of weather on rooftops - I can now leave the service work to one of the younger techs with better knees and concentrate on my primary job as company start-up man.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [Troubleshooting web-based HVAC control system networks](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/hvac/troubleshooting-web-based-hvac-control-system-networks)\n\n\n\n\n\nScenarios showing how to prevent system failures and downtime caused by HVAC network problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [My chiller plant is down, do you know how incredibly critical it is?](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/hvac/my-chiller-plant-is-down)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf chilled water flow is interrupted for even a few minutes the IT server room might overheat and critical computer services could go down. Another vital area is a hospital operating room. In a plant, essential machinery uses chilled water for process cooling. While many plants have excess capacity, much of this capacity is not available at high ambient temperature and high humidity conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [Powerful new 2-channel handheld oscilloscopes](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/oscilloscopes/powerful-new-2-channel-handheld-oscilloscopes)\n\n\n\n\n\nFluke ScopeMeter®190 Series II, 2-channel handheld oscilloscopes combine the power of a 2-channel oscilloscope with a 5000-count digital multimeter and paperless recording mode, creating an advanced test and measurement tool that service and maintenance professionals can rely on for troubleshooting equipment performance problems in the field\n\n\n\n\n\n**Article**\n\n- ### [ABCs of Portable Oscilloscopes: Part 5, Capturing intermittent and random events with a portable oscilloscope](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/learn/blog/oscilloscopes/abcs-of-portable-oscilloscopes-part-5-capturing-intermittent-and-random-events-with-a-portable-oscilloscope)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis final installment of the five-part series about using portable oscilloscopes covers how to \"capture\" waveforms that do not occur in a repeating and predictable way.

Connect the a3001 FC current module and read the results on your smartphone from a safe distance. You can save and share measurements from the field with your team anytime, from anywhere.\n\n### Isolating intermittent electrical faults easily\n\nLeave your a3001 connected to log measurements and walk away to address other issues. Download the data for further analysis on our phone. Record over time to monitor circuit load changes for an hour, a shift or a week. Use the Fluke Connect wireless USB adapter to collect logged data from remote modules by walking past a working module and downloading logged data.\n\n### Faster and cheaper 3-phase testing\n\nWhen your cabinet is de-energized, attach a Fluke a3001 FC Wireless iFlex AC Current Module to each phase. Close, re-energize and start taking readings in 1/3 of the time. What used to take hours and use costly equipment can be done in minutes with an affordable Fluke Connect wireless system.\n\n### Log, analyze, and diagnose easily You can solve problems faster by seeing live measurements from multiple test points on a single screen. Send data from the panel to your laptop and go from logging to analysis and diagnosis with the a3001 connected. Once you’ve gathered the measurements, you can perform for analysis with your PC and share the results using Fluke Cloud™ storage and ShareLive™ video call. Share and view data or graphs to get input from team members.\n\n### What's in the box:\n\n- a3001 Flexible Current Clamp Meter\n- iFlex i2500-10 Flexible Current Probe\n- Quick Reference Guide\n\n##

We are only able to ship orders with billing and shipping addresses in the United States.\n\n**How does 2-Day shipping work?**\n\nMost of our orders ship within 1-2 business days. Please note, calibrated and build-to-order products have longer lead times, as shown on the product pages. Orders for items that are out of stock, or available as a pre-order, are placed in the queue and shipped when they become available.\n\nDeliveries are scheduled for business days, so please allow for additional shipping time.\n\nActual delivery dates depend on order cutoff times and carrier delivery schedules. Deliveries can be delayed by service disruptions or if incomplete/inaccurate address and contact information was submitted with the order. Items that require a signature for delivery will be delayed if no one is available to receive the shipment.\n\nOnce the order has shipped an email notification with tracking information will be sent to the email address associated to the order.\n\n**Terms & Conditions**\n\nView Fluke's [Terms and Conditions](https://shop.fluke.com/pages/terms-and-conditions \"(opens in a new window)\")\n\nChat with ourFluke assistant\n\n\nClear Chat\n\nHi, I'm your virtual assistant, I will do my very best to help you navigate all things Fluke related.

See the list of authorized distributors at [https://www.fluke.com/en-us/where-to-buy](https://www.fluke.com/en-us/where-to-buy).\n\nFor purposes of this Coupon Offer, the term “Qualifying Fluke Products” means only the Fluke, Fluke Networks, Amprobe, and Pacific Laser Systems products listed on the Discount Coupon issued by a Fluke Representative. The discount allowed is equal to the amount indicated on the Discount Coupon (as defined in Section 3), which is not to exceed more than 10%.\n\n2. **Eligibility**\n\nFor purposes of the Coupon Offer, a customer must be at least 18 years of age, and a resident of the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, or Canada.\n\nOnly customers that are end-users and use the Qualifying Fluke Products for their own purposes are eligible to participate in the Coupon Offer. Distributors, resellers, and similar parties are expressly excluded from directly participating in the Coupon Offer.\n\nEmployees, directors and officers of the Sponsor, its parent companies, affiliated companies, subsidiaries, distributors, representatives, and those persons’ immediate families (parents, siblings, children and spouse) and persons living in the same household (whether related or not) are not eligible to participate in the Coupon Offer. Further, no employees, officers, directors, representatives or agents of (i) government entities, including government owned or controlled companies, (ii) distributors or (iii) competing tool manufacturers are eligible to participate in the Coupon Offer.\n\n3. **Instructions on How to Participate in the Coupon Offer**\n\nIn order to receive a discount under the Coupon Offer, all eligible end customers must follow the process stated below during the Coupon Offer Period (as defined in Section 4).\n\nEligible end customers must obtain a discount coupon from an authorized Fluke Representative (the “Discount Coupon”).

With three models covering the range of –25 °C to 660 °C, this family of Metrology Wells calibrates a wide range of sensor types. The optional process version (models 914X-X-P) provides a built-in two-channel thermometer readout that measures PRTs, RTDs, thermocouples, and 4-20 mA transmitters which includes the 24 V loop supply to power the transmitter.\n\nEach process version accepts an [ITS-90 reference PRT](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/product/calibration-tools/temperature-calibration/its-90-temperature-standards/its-90). The built-in readout accuracy ranges from ±0.01 °C to ±0.07 °C depending on the measured temperature. Reference PRTs for Field Metrology Wells contain individual calibration constants that reside in a memory chip located inside the sensor housing, so sensors may be used interchangeably. The second channel is user-selectable for 2-, 3-, or 4-wire RTDs, thermocouples, or 4-20 mA transmitters. For comparison calibration, don’t hassle with carrying multiple instruments to the field. Field Metrology Wells do it all as a single instrument.\n\nTraditionally, calibrations of temperature transmitters have been performed on the measurement electronics, while the sensor remained uncalibrated. Studies have shown, however, that typically 75% of the error in the transmitter system (transmitter electronics and temperature sensor) is in the sensing element. Thus, it becomes important to calibrate the whole loop—both electronics and sensor.\n\nThe process option of Field Metrology Wells makes transmitter loop calibrations easy. The transmitter sensor is placed in the well with the reference PRT and the transmitter electronics are connected to the front panel of the instrument. With 24 V loop power, you are able to power and measure the transmitter current while sourcing and measuring temperature in the Field Metrology Well. This allows for the measurement of as-found and as-left data in one self-contained calibration tool.\n\nAll Field Metrology Wells allow for two types of automated thermostatic switch test procedures—auto or manual setup. Auto setup requires the entry of only the nominal switch temperature. With this entry, it will run a 3-cycle calibration procedure and provide final results for the dead band temperature via the display. If you need to customize the ramp rate or run additional cycles, the manual setup allows you to program and run the procedure exactly how you would like. Both methods are fast and easy and make testing temperature switches a virtual joy!\n\n**Metrology performance for high-accuracy measurements**\n\nUnlike traditional dry-wells, Field Metrology Wells maximize speed and portability without compromising the six key metrology performance criteria laid out by the EA: accuracy, stability, axial (vertical) uniformity, radial (well-to-well) uniformity, loading, and hysteresis. All criteria are important in ensuring accurate measurements in all calibration applications. Field Metrology Well displays are calibrated with highquality traceable and accredited PRTs. Each device (process and non-process versions) comes with an IEC-17025 NVLAP-accredited calibration certificate, which is backed by a robust uncertainty analysis that considers temperature gradients, loading effects, and hysteresis. The 9142 and 9143 have a display accuracy of ±0.2 °C over their full range, and the 9144 display accuracy ranges from ±0.35 °C at 420 °C to ±0.5 °C at ±660 °C. Each calibration is backed with a 4:1 test uncertainty ratio.\n\nNew control technology guarantees excellent performance in extreme environmental conditions. The 9142 is stable to ±0.01 °C over its full range and the mid-range 9143 is stable from ±0.02 °C at 33 °C and ±0.03 °C at 350 °C. Even at 660 °C, the 9144 is stable to ±0.05 °C. But this is not all! Thermal block characteristics provide radial (well-towell) uniformity performance to ±0.01 °C. Dual-zone control helps these tools achieve axial uniformity to ±0.05 °C at 40 mm (1.6 in).\n\n**Automation and documentation make each unit a turnkey solution**\n\nSo you now have a precision calibration instrument that has field-ready characteristics, accredited metrology performance, built-in two-channel thermometry, and automation— what else could you ask for? How about all this and a turnkey solution that will automate and document the results?\n\nThe process versions of Field Metrology Wells have onboard non-volatile memory for documentation of up to 20 tests. Each test can be given a unique alphanumeric ID and will record block temperature, reference temperature, UUT values, error, date, and time. Each test can be easily viewed via the front panel. Use the [1586A Super-DAQ](https://www.fluke.com/en-au/product/calibration-tools/temperature-calibrators/fluke-calibration-1586a) to automate temperature sensor calibration with these Field Metrology Wells.\n\n**Operation is as easy as 1-2-3**\n\nYou’ll find Field Metrology Wells intuitive and easy to use. Each unit is equipped with a large, easy-to-read LCD display, function keys, and menu navigation buttons. Its “SET PT.” button makes it straightforward and simple to set the block temperature. Each product has a stability indicator that visually and audibly tells you the Field Metrology Wells is stable to the selectable criteria. Each unit offers preprogrammed calibration routines stored in memory for easy recall, and all inputs are easily accessible via the front panel of the instrument. Never buy a temperature calibration tool from a company that only dabbles in metrology (or doesn’t even know the word). Metrology Wells from Fluke are designed and manufactured by the same people who equip the calibration laboratories of the world’s leading temperature scientists. These are the people around the world who decide what a Kelvin is! We know a thing or two more about temperature calibration than the vast majority of the world’s dry-well suppliers. Yes, they can connect a piece of metal to a heater and a control sensor. But we invite you to compare all our specs against the few that they publish. (And by the way, we meet our specs!).\n\n**Small dry wells for big field applications**\n\nThe 9142, 9143, 9144 Field Metrology Wells extend high performance to the industrial process environment by maximizing portability, speed, and functionality with little compromise to metrology performance.\n\nField Metrology Wells are packed with functionality and are remarkably easy to use. They are lightweight, small, and quick to reach temperature set points, yet they are stable, uniform, and accurate. These industrial temperature loop calibrators are perfect for performing transmitter loop calibrations, comparison calibrations, or simple checks of thermocouple sensors. With the “process” option, there is no need to carry additional tools into the field. This optional built-in two-channel readout reads resistance, voltage, and 4–20 mA current with 24 volt loop power. It also has on-board automation and documentation. Combined, the three models (9142, 9143, and 9144—each with a “process” option) cover the wide range of –25 °C to 660 °C.\n\n**High performance for the industrial environment**\n\nField Metrology Wells are designed for the industrial process environment and fast speed to temperature. They weigh less than 8.2 kg (18 lb) and have a small footprint, which makes them easy to transport.\n\nField environment conditions are typically unstable, having wide temperature variations. Each Field Metrology Well has a built-in gradient-temperature compensation (patent pending) that adjusts control characteristics to ensure stable performance in unstable environments. In fact, all specifications are guaranteed over the environmental range of 13 °C to 33 °C.\n\n## Specifications: Fluke Calibration 9142 Field Metrology Well\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Base Unit Specifications |\n| Temperature range at 23°C | –25°C to 150°C (–13°F to 302°F) |\n| Display accuracy | ±0.2°C full range |\n| Stability | ±0.01°C full range |\n| Axial uniformity at 40 mm (1.6 in) | ±0.05°C full range |\n| Radial uniformity | ±0.01°C full range |\n| Loading effect (with a 6.35 mm reference probe and three 6.35 mm probes) | ±0.006°C full range |\n| Hysteresis | 0.025 |\n| Operating conditions | 0°C to 50°C, 0% to 90% RH (non-condensing) |\n| Environmental conditions (for all specifications except temperature range) | 13°C to 33°C |\n| Immersion (well) Depth | 150 mm (5.9 in) |\n| Insert OD | 30 mm (1.18 in) |\n| Heating time | 16 min: 23°C to 140°C<br>23 min: 23°C to 150°C<br>25 min: –25°C to 150°C |\n| Cooling time | 15 min: 23°C to –25°C<br>25 min: 150°C to –23°C |\n| Resolution | 0.01° |\n| Display | LCD, °C or °F user-selectable |\n| Size (H x W x D) | 290 x 185 x 295 mm (11.4 x 7.3 x 11.6 in) |\n| Weight | 8.16 kg (18 lb) |\n| Power requirements | 100 V to 115 V (±10%) 50/60 Hz, 635 W 230 V (±10%) 50/60 Hz, 575 W |\n| Computer interface | RS-232 interface |\n| Calibration | NVLAP accredited calibration included |\n| Automation | Use the 1586A Super-DAQ to automate temperature sensor calibration |\n| -P Specifications |\n| Built-in reference thermometer readout accuracy (4-Wire Reference Probe)1 | ±0.010°C at -25°C<br>±0.015°C at 0°C<br>±0.020°C at 50°C<br>±0.025°C at 150°C<br>±0.030°C at 200°C<br>±0.040°C at 350°C<br>±0.050°C at 420°C<br>±0.070°C at 660°C |\n| Reference resistance range | 0 ohms to 400 ohms |\n| Reference resistance accuracy2 | 0 ohms to 42 ohms: ±0.0025 ohms 42 ohms to 400 ohms: ±60 ppm of reading |\n| Reference characterizations | ITS-90, CVD, IEC-751, Resistance |\n| Reference measurement capability | 4-wire |\n| Reference probe connection | 6-pin Din with Infocon Technology |\n| Built-in RTD thermometer readout accuracy | NI-120: ±0.015°C at 0°C<br>PT-100 (385): ±0.02°C at 0°C<br>PT-100 (3926): ±0.02°C at 0°C<br>PT-100 (JIS): ±0.02°C at 0°C |\n| RTD resistance range | 0 ohms to 400 ohms |\n| RTD resistance accuracy2 | 0 ohms to 25 ohms: ±0.002 ohms<br>25 ohms to 400 ohms: ±80 ppm of reading |\n| RTD characterizations | PT-100 (385),(JIS),(3926), NI-120, Resistance |\n| RTD measurement capability | 4-wire RTD (2-,3-wire RTD w/ Jumpers only) |\n| RTD connection | 4 terminal input |\n| Built-in TC thermometer readout accuracy | Type J: ±0.7°C at 660°C<br>Type K: ±0.8°C at 660°C<br>Type T: ±0.8°C at 400°C<br>Type E: ±0.7°C at 660°C<br>Type R: ±1.4°C at 660°C<br>Type S: ±1.5°C at 660°C<br>Type M: ±1.4°C at 660°C<br>Type L: ±0.7°C at 660°C<br>Type U: ±0.75°C at 600°C<br>Type N: ±0.9°C at 660°C<br>Type C: ±1.1°C at 660°C |\n| TC millivolt range | –10 mV to 75 mV |\n| Voltage accuracy | 0.025% of reading + 0.01 mV |\n| Internal cold junction compensation accuracy | ±0.35°C (ambient of 13°C to 33°C) |\n| TC connection | Small connectors |\n| Built-in mA readout accuracy | 0.02% of reading + 2 mV |\n| mA range | Cal 4-22 mA, Spec 4-24 mA |\n| mA connection | 2 terminal input |\n| Loop power function | 24 V DC loop power |\n| Built-in electronics temperature coefficient (0°C to 13°C, 33°C to 50°C) | ±0.005% of range per °C |\n| 1\\.

Because Safety Matters.™\n\n![](https://dam-assets.fluke.com/s3fs-public/F-87_v_max_07a_w.jpg)\n\nLast year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized more counterfeit items that pose health and safety risks than ever before. Counterfeit test and measurement tools can be especially dangerous because they are typically low quality and can cause injuries.\n\nWhen you’re dealing with electrical safety, quality is important because it could be what stands between you and electric shock. With fake products, it’s hard to know for sure if they’ve been tested and even pass standards such as IEC. According to the NFPA, nearly 2,000 U.S. workplace injuries are caused by electrical hazards each year; taking a chance on your test tools or accessories isn’t worth it.\n\nAt Fluke, customer safety is our top priority. And, anyone who works with or around electricity knows that safety is paramount. It governs what you wear, how you work and the tools you carry. That’s why our products not only comply but exceed the requirements of IEC standards. We test each and every product and certify with independent third-party test laboratories such as CSA, VDE and UL to ensure our products are meeting all safety requirements. Our test leads go through more than 13 safety tests as called out by IEC 61010-031 to ensure they’re up to our high standards.\n\nIn our commitment to safety, Fluke is engaging in several efforts against counterfeit products. As we continue our efforts to reduce the number of fakes, we want you to be informed of the counterfeit situation. This page is a good source to help you make more informed purchasing decisions.\n\nYou can shop genuine Fluke products online or through one of our authorized distributors.\n\nGenuine Fluke.

They may not meet the necessary safety and quality that you need and expect with test tools and accessories. Using fake products can not only produce unreliable readings and can even lead to unplanned incidents from electric shocks and increase the possibility of arc faults caused by inadequate insulation or design.\n\nFake test leads and clips are often made from inadequate wire, polymers and terminal components and use dubious construction methods that may lead to premature failure and intermittency. They may not provide adequate or durable insulation to prevent electric shock due to leakage current, impact or wear. Knock off test leads may lead to **intermittent readings, overheating and pose a serious risk of arc flash or shock hazard** if used for measurements in commercial or industrial electrical installations.\n\nTest leads and clips made from improperly selected or poor-quality materials can also affect the readings recorded on a digital multimeter. For example, if dissimilar metals were used in the manufacture of the test leads, they can produce errors that are very difficult to trace if you are trying to measure very low voltage (e.g. in the mV range) or very low resistance, such as when working on low voltage electronic circuits. The contact between dissimilar metals can act like a thermocouple and generate its own voltage.\n\n### **How can I be sure that I purchase Genuine Fluke products?**\n\nBuy only from authorized distributors or online directly from Fluke.com. For an authorized Fluke partner near you, visit [https://www.fluke.com/en-us/where-to-buy](https://www.fluke.com/en-us/where-to-buy)\n\n### **I found Fluke products listed online from third party sellers. Is the product genuine or counterfeit?**\n\nAuthorized distributors may sell genuine Fluke test tools and accessories online. Double check the seller listed is an authorized Fluke distributor to be sure the product is genuine. Please visit [our Where to Buy page](https://www.fluke.com/en-us/where-to-buy) for a comprehensive list of Distributors in the United States.\n\n### **I found a site online that is offering a great price on a Fluke tool or accessory. How can I tell if they are authentic?**\n\nBe sure the test tool or accessory is being sold by an authorized Fluke distributor. Please check [our Where to Buy page](https://www.fluke.com/en-us/where-to-buy) for a list of authorized Fluke distributors.\n\nIf the listed price is too low compared to what you can find from authorized distributors, this could be an indication that you may be looking at counterfeit Fluke test tools or accessories.\n\n### **How do I determine if my test leads are counterfeit?**\n\nCounterfeit products vary in quality, both visually and their internal components. From a visual perspective, look for flimsy packaging, grammatical and spelling errors, flawed fonts, incorrect colors, old copyright dates, and shading on photographs. Also, be aware of where the product was purchased. Be cautious of fake websites (look at the URL), a failure to list contact details and unrealistic discounts.\n\nIf you suspect a counterfeit, [contact us](mailto:counterfeits@fluke.com).\n\nPlease see our YouTube video link or social media posts to learn more about geniune Fluke tools and accessories.\n\n![](https://dam-assets.fluke.com/s3fs-public/LEAD1.jpg)\n\n![](https://dam-assets.fluke.com/s3fs-public/LEAD2.jpg)\n\n### **I believe I bought a counterfeit item. What can I do?**\n\nPlease report suspected counterfeit product offerings [directly to us](mailto:counterfeits@fluke.com) so we may look into the issue and include the following:\n\n- Photos of the suspected counterfeit product\n- Link/s where purchased or spotted online\n- Physical address if you bought or saw the products in store\n- Seller name and any return address on the shipment and/or receipts\n- Date purchased\n\nFluke cannot repair or replace counterfeit products. Reach out directly to the Marketplace you purchased the product through. You can also search for “\\[list marketplace\\] report counterfeits” and that search should show where to report for each marketplace.\n\n### **Where I can find more information?**\n\nIf you haven’t submitted your information, please send us an [email](mailto:counterfeits@fluke.com) for more information about the legitimacy of your test tools or accessory.

Learn how to protect yourself from grey market products and counterfeit Fluke tools.\n\n## What are Grey Market products?\n\nGrey market products may be tools, parts, and/or accessories sold outside of a company’s authorized distribution channels.\n\n## Ensure your Fluke tools benefit from the manufacturer warranty\n\nCustomers should be aware that while Fluke products from grey market sellers may be genuine, these sellers may lack the capability to provide aftersales support and product training. Furthermore, customers take the risk that their purchases are not protected by the original manufacturer’s warranty.\n\nFluke tools enjoy the full benefit of an original manufacturer’s warranty, but this protection is only available when the tool is purchased through an authorized source. When it comes to electrical safety, your tools must perform to the highest standard. That’s why Fluke products not only comply with but exceed the requirements of IEC standards. When you buy from an authorized distributor, or directly through Fluke, you ensure those safety standards and full manufacturer warranty are there for you.\n\nOften, grey market sellers will pick up inventory from another source and resell it to make a profit. However, the warranty services provided by Fluke can only be obtained in the country the tool was originally purchased from Fluke or from a local authorized Fluke distributor or reseller.\n\nCustomers should be aware that only Fluke tools supplied by authorized distributors and resellers or directly from Fluke will be eligible for a product warranty, free-of-charge warranty repairs, and other services.\n\n## How to spot a grey market seller\n\nRecent advances with online shopping have made it easy for anyone to buy from online marketplaces, auction sites, or from sellers’ websites all over the world. These unauthorized resellers lead to grey market sales, or sales that go around the authorized distribution channels. These kinds of grey market sellers do not have a relationship with the original manufacturer of the tools since Fluke has not authorized these sellers.\n\nThere are many grey market sellers retailing Fluke products at artificially low prices. If the price appears too good, this lower price should raise a red flag that the tool may be grey market or possibly [counterfeit](https://www.fluke.com/en-us/where-to-buy/counterfeit-awareness).\n\nAs you’re shopping online, especially on websites that aggregate multiple sellers on one marketplace, double check where the seller is located and shipping from so you can be certain you are looking at genuine Fluke products being sold through one of our authorized distributors.\n\n## Authorized distributors\n\nTo ensure you purchase a genuine Fluke product, buy online or through one of our authorized distributors.

Save it. Share it.**\n\nAll the facts, right in the field. The Fluke a3000 FC Wireless AC Current Clamp Module is one member of a family of wireless test tools that let you share test data using the Fluke Connect® app with ShareLive™ video call.\n\nFluke Connect Wireless Test Tools put tools, not your body, near live electrical panels. It's simple. Connect the a3000 FC current clamp module, or any of the other Fluke Connect remote modules, and read the results on the Fluke Connect Wireless Multimeter or a portable PC from a safe distance.\n\nBetter still, the Fluke Connect test tools can send measurement data to your smartphone, so you can save and share measurements from the field with your team anytime, from anywhere.\n\n**Don't get bogged down while isolating intermittent electrical faults**\n\nTiming is everything when trying to find an intermittent problem and the hard part is, it doesn't always show up when you have your meter connected. We've solved that problem with Fluke Connect - leave your remote modules connected to log measurements and walk away to address other issues. You can then download the data for further analysis.\n\n**Work safely near electrical panels while wearing less PPE**\n\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE) can save your life, but it's bulky, hot and hard to work in. With Fluke Connect, there's no need to work in front of live open panels or moving/hazardous machinery.\n\nPicture having the ability to access live readings without being exposed to the live panel. It's easy. Just de-energize the cabinet, open the panel while wearing PPE and connect one or more a3000 FC modules. Close the cabinet, re-energize and let the Fluke Connect system work, reducing the risk of arc flash by separating yourself from hazardous measurement situations.\n\n**Testing 3-phase is now faster and cheaper**\n\nWhen your cabinet is de-energized, attach a Fluke Connect current clamp to each phase. Close, re-energize and start taking readings. What used to take hours and use costly equipment can be done in minutes with an affordable Fluke Connect wireless system.\n\n**Take 3-phase measurements in 1/3 of the time. Add your laptop and go from logging to analysis and diagnosis.**\n\nYou can solve problems faster by seeing live measurements from multiple test points on a single screen. Using a3000 FC current clamp modules, you can:\n\n- Take 3-phase measurements in 1/3 the time of previous methods.\n- Send data to your laptop and go from logging to analysis and diagnosis.\n- Record over time to monitor circuit load changes for an hour, a shift or a week.\n- Use the Fluke Connect wireless USB adapter to collect logged data from remote modules by walking past a working module and downloading logged data.\n- Perform for analysis with your PC and share the results using Fluke Cloud™ storage and ShareLive™ video call. View data or graphs to get input from team members.\n\n### What's in the box:\n\n- a3000 FC True-RMS AC Clamp Meter\n- Quick Reference Guide\n\n## Specifications: Fluke a3000 FC Wireless AC Current
